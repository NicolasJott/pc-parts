Users can even enjoy perks like ARGB lighting and a 270-degree rotating blockhead that is simple to use. On top of that, the blockhead boasts a unique irregular aesthetic that is both stylish and artistic. Every single component of the MAG CORELIQUID Series is designed with the end goal in mind: to provide effective cooling without any compromise. Mount the cold plate at any orientation, turn the blockhead up to 270 degrees, and keep it upright.The pump has been integrated into the radiator for sound dampening and noise reduction. Additionally, placing the pump into the radiator also increases the pump's life expectancy by moving it away from the heat source. A durable three phase motor at the core of the pump generates minimal vibrations for long-lasting operation. A split pathway through the radiator rapidly dissipates heat, cooled liquid is then pumped back into the loop.
